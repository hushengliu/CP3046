== Description ==

**Lively Chat Support puts the power of connecting with visitors in the palm of your hand. You get:**

* Extremely customizable live chat for your visitors to interact with.
* "Offline Mode" works as a lead-capturing machine while you sleep. You can even customize your thank you message (maybe offer a freebie for signing up).
* [Great customer service.](http://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/lively-chat-support)
* Boost your conversion rates with one of our premium addons!

== Installation ==

1. Visit the Plugins page. Click "Add New", search for "Lively Chat Support", and click install. "Activate" Lively Chat Support.
1. On the left sidebar, click on "Lively Chat Support".
1. Enter your name and email (so we know where to send the offline messages).
1. Visit the settings page to customize your chatbox!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= After installing Lively, my site is showing a memory error. How do I fix it? =
* The issue is likely caused from having many plugins installed in a small shared-hosting environment.
* The solution is to increase your `WP_MEMORY_LIMIT`. In your wp-config.php, add `define('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '96M');` after the opening `<?php`. You may need to re-install the plugin.

= Lively isn't showing up on my site? =
* Are you using a caching plugin? If so, clear the cache.
* Is wp_footer() found anywhere in your theme's files? It should be in footer.php.

= Why are the timestamps in my chatbox wrong? =
You probably haven't set your timezone. You can do so in the General settings page of Wordpress.

= For SMS, how do I handle multiple conversations? =
Each message you receive begins with a small token and a colon (eg. 4k2:). To respond to a specific conversation, type "4k2: YOUR MESSAGE HERE". If you don't include this token in your response, we'll just send it back to the customer that last sent you a message.

= Why doesn't my SMS doesn't work? =
* Ensure your phone numbers include the country code (1 for North America, 44 for UK, etc.)
* The Wordpress ajax requests require access to the back end of your site. Ensure remote IPs aren't blocked for your back end, or you won't be able to send or receive SMS.
* Make sure http://yourdomain.com/?from_twilio=true actually links to a Wordpress page (sometimes, you may have a splash screen). If it doesn’t, you’re likely fine with http://yourdomain.com/index.php?from_twilio=true (or any other Wordpress page).

= Is Lively Chat Support completely free? =
Lively is FREE to use, but there are a few premium addons. They are:

= Is Lively Chat Support compatible with Multi-Site? =
No. Because of security concerns, we would advise NOT using it on Multi-Site installations.

== Screenshots ==

1. A great looking chatbox that is easy to tailor to your brand.
2. Admin view is clean and easy to operate. 
3. Customize your chatbox with your brand's colours, and upload your own Call To Action images.
4. Set your chat to always be online, always be offline, or never show. In version 1.0, we'll be introducing a new way to schedule your online hours.
5. Manage who your visitors will be chatting with.

7. Schedule the hours you are available (pairs perfectly with our SMS Addon).
